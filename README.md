Obviously 1st Git Hub repository

Hi all

Messing around with this kind of stuff.  
Started off in Professional IT roles as a Fortran 77 programmer.
Was also downsizing from a mainframe on to server-client network (IBM RS6000's).
OS was AIX\UNIX specialising with the then new Korneshell.

Since then upgraded my qualis' with MSc in Intelligent Systems (AI etc).
Came out and started working on Windows support., 
Worked in various network\infrastructure\admin roles.

Now getting interested in AI and programming again!! 

Wee Hee!
